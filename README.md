# The Bleak Dungeon
A text-based adventure written in Java. This was originally made as a paid client request but the client changed his mind entirely and requested something else, so the game was unused despite completion. It was purposefully made using basic Java and is fully contained in one file to facilitate understanding for Java beginners.
